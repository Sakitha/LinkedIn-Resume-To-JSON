# LinkedIn_Resume_To_JSON
An approach to phrase LinkedIn resume files with python and pdfminer.     
This program outputs json arrays for all the segmants in the resume. 
Input pdf file path should be given as the argumant for the following function in the first cell.
  fp = open('./profile.pdf', 'rb')
Hope this helps.
